### `Latest`
# **Version 1.1**
This is the first proper update to the app with new functionality.

#### What's New
- Choose your preferred way to open tweets and DMs - in the official Twitter app, Tweetbot, browser or in-app Safari. Your preference is saved in settings, and can be changed at any time. If your favorite option is not supported - please send a feature request!

- Unread message preview now shows the last message, not first, so it's easier to spot whether you got additional new messages.

#### Bug Fixes
- Now using your preferred external mail client to send mail (in case you want to reach out)
- Fixed occasional text jumping on the main screen
