Away for Twitter app ("the app") is a client application for Twitter. To provide core functionality, the app needs to make many requests to Twitter’s service. Please read [Twitter’s privacy policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy) for more details on what they may do with that data. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at any time by sending an email to [awayfortwitter@hybridcattt.com](mailto:awayfortwitter@hybridcattt.com).

## Communication with Twitter servers

The app communicates with Twitter servers directly. No data is shared with the app's developer, Hybrid Cat ApS ("the developer"). 

## Authentication

The app uses a special authentication token to load your account's data from Twitter servers. The token is obtained only once, when you use your Twitter credentials to log in. The Twitter credentials are not accessed or stored by the app. The app uses a private and secure session during authentication. 

## Local data storage

The app locally stores some of the data it loads from Twitter. 

The app stores your authentication token in order to be able to load your account's data from Twitter. The token is stored securely in Keychain. 

The app also caches your account name, as well as other technical data such as your Twitter user id. 

## Personal Information

All personal information obtained from Twitter stays on device, and is never shared with the developer. 

## Analytics

The app does not use any third-party analytics services.

## Email newsletter

Sometimes we ask you to give us your email. This happens when you give us your email address to receive a beta app invite, as well as when you subscribe to receive product updates. 

We securely store your email and don't share it with any third party except the third-party software we use to manage sending of emails. Currently we use Revue for email management. Please review [Revue's Privacy Policy](https://www.getrevue.co/privacy/platform?locale=en).
